## Design Understanding and Justification

I created the design prototype in Adobe XD with several laws of UX in mind for a better user experience and more intuitive UX/UI. My understanding for common laws of UX helped me create a user-friendly experience that can drive sales and increase revenue for a company.

- A used a conventional navigation at the top of the page and footer at the bottom of the page, as well as familiar icons to represent links to the shopping cart and log-in form. These conventions simplify the user's learning process and accelerate the ability to learn to navigate the website without confusion. (Jakob's Law)
- The sections and subsections demonstrate chunking and breaking up different bits of information to make the content easier to comprehend for the user. (Miller's Law)
- Selling products is the ultimate goal of an e-commerce website, therefore I utilized Fitts' Law by creating a CTA button ("Shop CBD") in the home-page header that leads to products for sale. I also made the products section the first full section upon scrolling the page.
