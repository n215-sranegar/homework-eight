## I've decided to take this opportunity to create pages that I can use for a e-commerce prototype that I have been working on this semester. (Permission granted by Todd to use another project from another class)

I really enjoy implementing JQuery to create a more dynamic web experience. I noticed that the loading time is faster than what I have experienced in the past. 

I'm excited to be using more JavaScript in our projects. I want to improve upon my JavaScript and start focusing on creating more dynamic web experiences.
