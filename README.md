## Design Understanding and Justification

📱 I focused my design to be user-friendly and responsive + adaptable. I followed many laws of UX to achieve this design layout for a CBD company that solves the problem of creating an online platform to sell their products. 

⚗️ I followed current conventions, such as a standard navigation at the top of the page and footer at the bottom of the page. The sections and subsections are broken up kindly to keep the user informed and interested. This user-friendly experience can drive sales and increase revenue for the company.

🔮 I've achieved fast loading times and high speed by resizing all photos in Adobe Photoshop. I created the prototype for this design in Adobe XD for guidance. 

🛸 Implementing JQuery for the reviews section makes the page more dynamic. CSS animations were used in buttons, mobile-navigation, subscription cards, and other hover effects.
