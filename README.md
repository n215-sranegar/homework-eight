# Homework Eight

### I've decided to take this opportunity to create pages that I can use for an e-commerce prototype that I have been working on this semester. (Permission granted by Todd to use another project from another class)

I included five links instead of four because the home page is from a previous project. Products, about, contact, and login are all new pages that I created for this assignment. 

In this project I focused on using jQuery to load all of the web content and different pages into one single page. I also made all pages responsive and adaptive.

I really enjoy learning jQuery to create a more dynamic web experience. I noticed that the loading time is faster than what I have experienced in the past. 

I'm excited to be using more JavaScript in our projects. I want to improve upon my JavaScript and start focusing on creating more dynamic web experiences.
